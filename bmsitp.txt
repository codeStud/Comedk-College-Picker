THE PLACEMENT CELL
The department of Placement and Training was established during the year 2004. The very first batch of students under this department were placed from the campus in 2005-06. Initially the placement department collaborated with the department in BMSCE campus. As of date the department is fully sustained and provides complete placement solutions to the students of the institute.

There has been a steady increase in the number of recruiting organizations since its establishment and at present we have around 150 organizations where in BMSIT alumni are making a difference, both to the glory of the company and an active change in the society.

The department facilitates the entire recruitment process by coordinating with various facilities in the campus. For the students to be placed in the prestigious organizations that come for recruitment, the department provides a complete training solution involving in house faculty and industry interactions. The students are also motivated to choose their career by the experienced alumni at prestigious posts.
